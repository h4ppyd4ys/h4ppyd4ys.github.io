## **Overview**  


As mentioned in my previous post, the journey with Tableau continued with Coursera. This time following the money trail with UK politics and the declared money spent on advertising. I also figured how to embed the interactive dashboard to the blog page so very pleased. Still looking forward to exploring more datasets and learning about the different charts and formatting options so watch this space. In the meantime, if you want any dashboards made for your data ping me. I am like the cookie monster these days, hunting for interesting and fun data sets. ðŸ˜Š
