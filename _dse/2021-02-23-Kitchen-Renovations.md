Having fun with infographics on tableau.

I had a quick look at Power BI today and decided to recreate the kitchen infographic to compare the tools and experiences. Tableau, for me, was by far the more intuitive and user-friendly application. With power BI, I struggled to figure out how to move simple text boxes into place, the drag and drop didn’t work for me, even after searching for help. I couldn’t locate the corresponding bubble chart in Power BI. One [forum](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/Need-to-develop-a-bubble-chart-like-packed-bubble-in-tableau/td-p/981356) I checked seems to suggest it may not be possible or may be possible with some customization to the [scatter plot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-scatter). From what I have read, Power BI does offer better features for more complex data and ad hoc needs. I will have to spend some more time with it. However for simple infographics like this one, my experience with Tableau was much more enjoyable, as is also demonstrated by the output, I think.
