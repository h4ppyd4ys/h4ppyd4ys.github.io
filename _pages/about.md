Namaste. Welcome to my first blogging space
{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery"%}

##  Past
Iâ€™ve happily spent most of my professional career traversing the globe learning, sharing and innovating in the telecommunications transformation space. Planes, trains, hotels, people, cultures and family reunions. The loneliness and exhilaration. With heartfelt gratitude and the benefits of 2020 hindsight, i can honestly say i wouldn't change a thing.  

##  Present
As the planet embraces global transformation with varying degrees of acceptance, i too find myself in a position to pursue fresh opportunities. From reflection and contemplation, it became very apparent that change has been a common theme and the only real constant of my life. We spend our lives as roles, some of these so clearly demarcated in online platforms such as linkedIn, facebook, instagram and twitter.  

This space is an exploration. Connecting transformation experiences, to perhaps appreciate, within the boundaries of language, algorithms, people and technology, the strength that unity brings and the balancing nature of diversity.

##  Future

My professional journey has afforded me with 20 years of international telecoms experience, working with industry leaders to implement large transformation programs.  If you are seeking   *independent transformation consulting* support that advocates transparency, accountability, quality and traceability head over to my [CV](/cv/), where I have quite honestly described my areas of expertise.  

As we rapidly transition into a world where, for better or worse, we begin to rely on the mysterious cloud and so called big data, I wanted to understand more. So i opened the pandoras box of [data science](/assets/images/datasc.jpg) and dived into the [AWS Cloud Fundamentals](/assets/images/AWS.jpg) rabbit hole.  It is with these newly gained skills that I present to you this site and the [data science explorations](link here) space. Transforming curiosities in the world of data.    

[Cosmic adventures](link here) brings together, one legendary 1995 VW campervan and the realization of a lifelong fascination with the night sky. Transforming light with astro photogrpahy.

Time and attention are the most precious gifts we can offer to ourselves and one another, so much appreciated if you've stayed with me till here. Hope you enjoy the space.

Namaste
&
may the force be with you. ;)
