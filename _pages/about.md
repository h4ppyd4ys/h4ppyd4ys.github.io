Namaste. Welcome to my first blogging space
{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery"%}

##  Past
Iâ€™ve happily spent most of my professional career traversing the globe learning, sharing, and innovating in the telecommunications transformation space. The plane was my lounge,  and taxi drivers, my welcoming party, delivering me to temporary homes where new cultures and people awaited discovery. I can honestly say, with the benefit of 2020 hindsight,  I wouldn't change a thing. 
##  Present
As the planet embraces global transformation with varying degrees of acceptance, I too find myself in a position to pursue fresh opportunities. Through reflection and contemplation, it became apparent that change has been the only real constant in my life. We spend our lives as roles, some of these so clearly demarcated in online platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. This space is an exploration. Connecting transformation experiences, to perhaps appreciate, within the boundaries of language, algorithms, people, and technology, the strength that unity brings and the balancing nature of diversity.
##  Future
My professional journey has afforded me 20 years of international telecoms experience, working with industry leaders to implement large transformation programs.  If you are seeking   *independent transformation consulting* support that aspires for *win-win solutions* and advocates *transparency, accountability, quality, and traceability* head over to my [CV](/cv/), where I have summarized my areas of expertise.   

As we rapidly transition into a world where, for better or worse, we begin to rely on the mysterious cloud and so-called big data, I wanted to understand more. So I opened pandora's box of [data science](/assets/images/datasc.jpg) and dived into the [AWS Cloud Fundamentals](/assets/images/AWS.jpg) rabbit hole.  It is with these newly gained skills that I present to you this site and the [data science explorations](/dse/) space. *Transforming curiosities in the world of data*.    

[Cosmic adventures](/cosmic/) brings together, one legendary 1995 VW campervan and the realization of a lifelong fascination with the night sky to capture and *transform light* from distant stars, galaxies, and planets with Astrophotography.

Time and attention are the most precious gifts we can offer to ourselves and one another, so much appreciated if you've stayed with me till here. Hope you enjoy the space.


Namaste
&
may the force be with you. ;)
