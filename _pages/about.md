Namaste. Welcome to my first blogging space
{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery"%}

##  Past
Iâ€™ve happily spent most of my professional career traversing the globe learning, sharing and innovating in the telecommunications transformation space. Planes, trains, hotels, people, cultures and family reunions. The loneliness and exhilaration. With heartfelt gratitude and the benefit of 2020 hindsight, i can honestly say i wouldn't change a thing.  

##  Present
As the planet embraces global change with varying degrees of acceptance, i too find myself with opportunities to try something new. From reflection and contemplation, it became very apparent that transformation has been a common theme in all areas of my life. We spend our lives as roles, some of which are so clearly demarcated in online platforms such as linkedIn, facebook, instagram and twitter.  

Within the boundaries of language and algorithms, this space is an experimentation with unification. Connecting transformation experiences and appreciating the balance and innovation that diversity brings.  


##  Future

My professional journey has afforded me with 20 years of international telecoms experience working with industry leaders to implement large transformation programs.  If you are seeking   *independent transformation consulting* support that advocates transparency, accountability, quality and traceability head over to my [CV](/cv/), where I have quite honestly described my areas of expertise and please feel free to contact me if I can be of assistance. 

As we rapidly transition into world where, for better or worse, we begin to rely on the mysterious cloud and so called big data, I wanted to understand more. So i opened the pandoras box of [data science](/assets/images/datasc.jpg) and dived into the [AWS Cloud Fundamentals](/assets/images/AWS.jpg) rabbit hole.  It is with these newly gained skills that I bring to you this site and the [data science explorations](link here) space.

[Cosmic adventures](link here) brings to the space, one legendary 1995 VW campervan, flo, who is presently meditating it out in London lockdown and the realization of a lifelong fascination with the night sky in the form of astro photography, presently going through a steep but enjoyable learning curve and patiently waiting for clear skies. 

Time and attention are the most precious gifts we can offer to ourselves and one another, so much appreciated if you've stayed with me till here. Hope you enjoy the space.

Namaste
&
May the force be with you.
