To the moon and back

Some say its just a dead rock.   
I've heard, she moves the oceans with her silence.  
They whisper, even the light giver cannot keep his glance away.  
He can resist for merely a day.  
The wise ones say no words will be heard,  
but if you spend a moment  
her secrets, she will gladly share.
