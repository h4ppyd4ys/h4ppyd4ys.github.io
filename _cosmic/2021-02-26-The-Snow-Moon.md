And so it begins with a moment as all things do. The start of a beautiful relationship.   

The belly button thingy is the Tycho Crater, one of the most prominent craters on the moon. Samples collected from the Apollo 17 landing are thought to be from this site and, if true, it is said to have been formed 108 million years ago.

It is said we came from the same  
and formed in dance.    
She chose surrender  
so that we could be.  
Visible scars bare witness to the  
protection she continues to give.  
And still, it is she  
that the oceans seek.  
For me she is clarity from within.  
In darkness and light
we dance in circles  
exchanging secrets through
shared awareness.
