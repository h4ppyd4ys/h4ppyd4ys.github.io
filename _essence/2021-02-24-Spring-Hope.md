Cosmic transformations captured in light at the microscopic level

{% include gallery class="full" %}


As the last days of rest and restoration fulfill their promises
the suns and moons of spring rise to give hope to new beginnings.    
I am in darkness where there is only love.

It is the eyes, you see  
through smoke and mirrors  
seek for seer who is the key  
It is the eyes, do you see?
